# 2D-Lights
Very simple 2D lighting system

Create the light from the GameObject menu under Lights. Add a material to it. There is a material I created for testing you probably will want to change it.

Code mostly comes from Sebastian Lagues tutorial for a field of view system. I converted the code to work in the 2D environment which works as a simple light: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQG9aUWarwE
